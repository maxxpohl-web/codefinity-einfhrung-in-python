# Step 1: Define a variable for the total cost of groceries 
total_cost = 25.00

# Step 2: Use the total cost variable to check if the grocery bill is eligible for a discount using the greater than or equal to operator (>=)
discountEligible = total_cost >= 20.00

# Step 3: Print the result using the boolean variable
print("Is the purchase eligible for a discount?", discountEligible)
